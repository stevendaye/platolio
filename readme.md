# Platolio | A Light-weight platform build for Developers

Platolio is a light-weight platform build for developers, where each developer can see its dashboard and connect with other devs.

# Why Platolio
Unlike the Raddict App which I concentrated much of my time using on the frontend Handelbars.js and its Helpers, here I will be using
React. After Learning React & Redux and seeing how much I was limited by Handlebars.js and imagining all the potential and power I
can unleash on the frontend using these technologies, I decided to build Platolio using mainly React & Redux on the front-end.
At the same time, I am buidling this to put together as well the following technolgies I learned seperately: MongoDB, Express, React
and Node, forming the MERN Stack. However, because I am looking for new challenges, I aim to add much more features than in Raddict.

# Technologies Used
 - ES6 & ES7
 - Node & Express
 - React & Redux
 - MongDB
 - Socket.IO & EventEmitter
 - Docker
 - Webpack
 - Babel
 - Microservices (My favourite way of developing web apps)
 - TDD & BDD
 - SSL
 - Third Party Authentication Services
 - Grunt, Postman, chai, Enzyme and many more that I might be missing in this list

# Running The Project
  /*Platform*/
  - cd platform
  - npm i
  - npm run dev(Make sure the user microservice bellow is first running in another termimal)

  /*Users*/
  - cd users
  - npm i
  - npm run server

# Important Notes
To test this project, you must make sure your are running an instance of MongoDB or simply visit soon https://www.platolio.co
